- Create the Limon RTMPC class based on Sampath implementation
- Implement for both CCTMPC and Limon RTMPC the computation of region of attraction. It will be a polytope, so we can check the dimension to avoid recomputing by error if already computed with that level of detail (or gamma!)

- implement the plotting part: it must take the results for each step of the computation and save it in a storageClass

- do everything for the 4D example.

-write both the readme in markdown and add the license suggested by Bemporad.
